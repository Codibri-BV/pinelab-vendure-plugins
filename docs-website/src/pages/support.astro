            A license allows you to use the plugin in 1 project, which means 1
            Vendure production database. You can use the plugin in as many
            non-production databases and server instances as you'd like, as long
            as that specific project only has 1 production database.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-500 mb-4">
            Always consult the plugin's included <strong>LICENSE</strong> file for
            legally binding terms.
