# Vendure Customer Group Extensions

This plugin allows customers to manage their own groups, called Customer Managed Groups. Customer Managed Groups can have Group Admins and Group participants.

- Customers can only be in one group, and they are either group participant or group admin. (Customers can still be in multiple)
- Customers can create groups and add other non-admin customers to their group. Adding others to your group automatically makes you administrator of the group.
- Group Admins can fetch placed orders for everyone in the group.

## Getting started

// TODO Setup plugin, create a group, assign admin

// graphql queries for shop api
