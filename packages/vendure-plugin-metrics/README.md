# Vendure Metrics plugin

### [Official documentation here](https://pinelab-plugins.com/plugin/vendure-plugin-metrics)

A plugin to visualize your shops most important metrics. Includes server side visitor tracking to calculate conversion rate.

## Getting started

1. Configure the plugin in `vendure-config.ts`:

```ts
import { MetricsPlugin } from "@pinelab/vendure-plugin-metrics";

plugins: [
  ...
    MetricsPlugin.init({
      // Consider displaying fewer months for shops with a lot of orders
      displayPastMonths: 13
    }),
    AdminUiPlugin.init({
      port: 3002,
      route: 'admin',
      app: compileUiExtensions({
        outputPath: path.join(__dirname, '__admin-ui'),
        extensions: [MetricsPlugin.ui],
      }),
    }),
  ...
]
```

2. Rebuild your Admin UI
3. Run a database migration to add the necessary tables to your database.
4. Start your Vendure server and login as administrator
5. You should now be able to add the widget `Advanced Metrics` to your dashboard.

Metric results are cached in memory to prevent heavy database queries every time a user opens its dashboard.

### Built-in Metrics

1. Revenue (per product): The total revenue per month, or the revenue generated by specific variants if a variant is selected.
2. Average Order Value (AOV): The average of `order.totalWithTax` of the orders per month
3. Units sold: The number of units sold for the selected variant(s).
4. Conversion Rate: The percentage of visitors that have converted to orders.
5. Visitors: The number of visitors per month.

# Custom Metrics

You can implement the `MetricStrategy` interface and pass it to the `MetricsPlugin.init()` function to have your custom metric visible in the Widget.
Below is the implementation of the conversion metric, already included in the plugin, but it serves as an example of how to implement a custom metric.

```ts
// This is the existing conversion metric, already included in the plugin

import { Order, RequestContext } from '@vendure/core';
import {
  AdvancedMetricType,
  Visit,
  MetricStrategy,
  NamedDatapoint,
} from '@pinelab/vendure-plugin-metrics';

/**
 * Conversion of visitors to orders
 */
export class ConversionMetric implements MetricStrategy {
  readonly metricType: AdvancedMetricType = AdvancedMetricType.Number;
  readonly code = 'conversion';
  readonly allowProductSelection = false;

  getTitle(ctx: RequestContext): string {
    return `Conversion Rate`;
  }

  calculateDataPoints(
    ctx: RequestContext,
    orders: Order[],
    visits: Visit[],
    variants: ProductVariant[]
  ): NamedDatapoint[] {
    // Here you would calculate your metric data points, based on the orders, visits and variants

    const placedOrders = orders.length;
    const visitorCount = visits.length;
    // Calculate conversion rate (as a percentage)
    let conversionRate = 0;
    if (visitorCount > 0) {
      conversionRate = (placedOrders / visitorCount) * 100;
    }
    if (conversionRate > 100) {
      // Conversion rate cannot be more than 100%
      conversionRate = 100;
    }

    // Most metrics return a single data point, which results in a single line in the chart.
    // But you can return multiple data points, which results in multiple lines in the chart.
    // For example, you could return a 'times purchased' per variant
    return [
      {
        legendLabel: 'Conversion Rate (%)',
        value: parseFloat(conversionRate.toFixed(2)),
      },
    ];
  }
}
```
