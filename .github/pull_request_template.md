# The art of good Pull Requests

Writing good PR's can be hard here are some tips ðŸ”§:

- **Write small, self-contained PR's,** that just add a single feature. Adding multiple features? Please split your PR into multiple PR's
- Please add testcases for new features. Another developer should get an understanding of what your feature is doing by just reading the testcases.
- Please review your own PR before making it ready to review to other developers. This helps you catch simple things like typo's and unused console.log statements.
- Check the README: Is it still up to date? Is your new feature documented?
